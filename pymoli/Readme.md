Heroes of Pymoli is a challenge to use the Pandas liberary of Python and Jupyter Notebooks to run analytics on sales data and generate a business intellegence report on 
a fictional game called "Heroes of Pymoli". 

Files in the Repository:

*****ESSENTIAL FILES*****

Pymoli_Final_with_plots.ipynb - this is the notebook file with final code. It also contains some plots I generated to supplement the core analysis using matplotlib

HOP_Spending_Analysis.docx - this is my finished report. 

Output_plots - this folder contains .png outputs from the code in the above notebook

purchase_data.csv - this is the data used in the analysis


*****DEVELOPMENTAL CHECKPOINTS*****

The files in this list are partial solutions that I saved as checkpoints. I'm listing them in reverse chronological order.

Pymoli_Final.ipynb - The Pandas code is the same as the final draft but with less commentary and no plots

pymoli_formatted.ipynb - This is a working version with cleaned up code and formatted dataframe outputs

pymoli_working.ipynb - this is the earliest full solution in the repo, but contains some sections that were later rewritten using methods I find more elegant

pymoli, pymoli2 and pymoli_3 - These are partial solutions.
